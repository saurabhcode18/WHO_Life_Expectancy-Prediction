Life Expectancy Prediction Model

This repository contains a machine learning model built to predict Life Expectancy using WHO global health indicators. The goal is to understand the strongest factors influencing longevity and build an accurate regression model.

Model Performance:

After training and evaluating the model on real-world WHO data, the results are:
Metric Score

R² Score = 0.8093
MAE	=  2.9606
mse = 16.5249


Interpretation:

The model explains 80.9% of the variation in life expectancy across countries.
This is considered strong performance for global health datasets with high variability
